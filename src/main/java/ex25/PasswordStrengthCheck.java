Exercise 25 - Password Strength Indicator
        Functions help you abstract away complex operations, but they also help you build
        reusable components.

        Create a program that determines the complexity of a given password based on these rules:

        A very weak password contains only numbers and is fewer than eight characters.
        A weak password contains only letters and is fewer than eight characters.
        A strong password contains letters and at least one number and is at least eight characters.
        A very strong password contains letters, numbers, and special characters and is at least
        eight characters.

        Example Output
        The password '12345' is a very weak password.
        The password 'abcdef' is a weak password.
        The password 'abc123xyz' is a strong password.
        The password '1337h@xor!' is a very strong password.
        Constraints
        Create a passwordValidator function that takes in the password as its argument and returns a value you
        can evaluate to determine the password strength. Do not have the function return
        a stringâ€”you may need to support multiple languages in the future.
        Use a single output statement.
